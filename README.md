# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 13 - Improvement on yanuthone D production in Aspergillus niger

## Project summary 
The aim of the project was to design and optimise a cell factory to produce the medically important antibiotic "yanuthone D". The chosen cell factory was *A. niger* because yanuthone D's pathway is native to *A. niger*. Flux balance analysis (FBA) was performed using the python package "Cobrapy".

## Project overview
The project is organized into two main sections: the analysis and the report. 

The report can be found in the Jupyter notebook "**Report.ipynb**" and provides information on the compound of interest and the  cell factory used, as well as on the model that has been utliized to perform the analysis. The report contains a throughout explanation of how and why the analysis was performed. 

The analysis can be found in the folder "**Analysis**", which contains seven subfolders with each of them containing a different analysis. Computations have been performed on:
- Maximum theoretical yields
- Model Optimization
- Model comparison
- Model pathway validation
- Phenotypic phase planes
- Predicted genes for manipulation
- DFBA

Details on the requirements for this project can be found in **requirements.txt.**
